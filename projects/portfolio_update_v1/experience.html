        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am a high school graduate from one of the best and well achieved schools in my home town of Pretoria. The school has been praised for having high attendance and a 100% pass rate.</p>
        <p>After high school, I furthered my studies in the culinary arts at a private institute located close to the countries capital building. This chef academy is one of the most pristine culinary schools in the country and is responsible for some of the best the country has ever seen.</p>
        <p>I have done a one year course in business management and principles at the IIE, a private business college.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>While I was still in high school, I worked at my local video store learning the ins and outs of a business and working with customers.</p>
        <p>While I was studying at the college they send us out on practical placements to profesional kitchens in order to build up work experience.</p>
        <p>Soon after my graduation, I got a job as a full time chef at a restaurant and worked there for two years as a professional chef.</p>
        <p>Over those two years I decided on a career change and worked for a private contracting firm over seeing projects.</p>
